        <h4 class="text-info">Please read: Important things to keep in mind when using any of the models</h4>
        <p><b>Please keep scale in mind:</b> The results from this project provide guidance regarding the spatial distribution and factors affecting viability of stopover sites, and can be specifically incorporated into a wide range of plans and planning processes, including the Upper Mississippi River and Great Lakes Region Joint Venture; lake-wide conservation plans for Lakes Michigan, Huron, Erie and Ontario that have been developed by The Nature Conservancy; state wildlife action plans; and other regional plans that include protection of migratory birds, such as the Wisconsin Bird Conservation Initiative and Chicago Wilderness. The models produced with this project build upon stopover models developed earlier as we have incorporated results from new literature in these models.  Yet, the regional models lack some detail provided in earlier work where local, fine resolution data layers were available. Users at any one site may find it most valuable to review both the Great Lakes regional model and more localized models when applying this work for conservation purposes.  We suggest that the maps produced by the models and displayed on this web portal are best seen as a screening tool for choosing among options at larger spatial scales that should be complemented with local information on habitat quality when used to make conservation decisions.</p>
		<p>
		<b>Remember the resolution of the data:</b>  We aggregated raster data layers with a resolution of 30m (approximately 0.1 ha) pixels into 100 m (1 ha) pixels to approximate the minimum size of areas in which migrants move during any one stopover event.  The most common, or majority, land cover was assigned to each 1 ha pixel; some fine scale ecological information is lost with this approach. However, this aggregation facilitated data analysis and summarization, is more consistent with the spatial scale at which conservation actions are implemented than a 30 m resolution, and is similar to the approach taken by Stralberg et al. (2011).  However, we recognize that some areas &lt; ha may be very important for birds under some circumstances and may not be identified as stopover sites with this approach if they have been aggregated with a “non-habitat” landcover type.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>Habitat characteristics that we couldn’t “map” with GIS at the regional scale are still important:</b> Although we considered both landscape and site influences on stopover habitat selection and use by migrants in our models, both of which governed the choice of spatial scale of analysis, the models are based on landscape features because there are insufficient data layers describing site features, such as vegetation structure or plant species composition, at a regional or more local scale.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>Spring and fall migrations likely differ; these models are based on spring migrations:</b> The attributes selected, and values for each attribute, primarily reflect migrant distribution in the spring when landbirds, and possibly other bird groups, are most concentrated near large bodies of water like the Great Lakes.  However, it is likely that many important fall migration areas in our study area are captured by our models.

For this bird group, we divided the study area into two zones – within 1 km of the shoreline, and ≥ 1 km - 25 km from a Great Lake or connecting water body. This scoring reflects the assumption that all habitat very close to a Great Lake or connecting water body will be heavily used by landbirds, regardless of habitat type, context, or distance to another water body. “Pixels” in this table refer to the 1 ha scale pixels developed from the 30 m scale landcover

Please keep the following in mind when using the Landbird Model:
<ul>
<li>
Most applicable to forest- and shrub-dependent species; somewhat useful for raptors; not applicable to species such as Horned Lark (<i>Eremophila alpestris</i>), American Pipit (<i>Anthus rubescens</i>), and Snow Bunting (<i>Plectrophenax nivalis</i>), which are primarily found in agricultural lands, bare soil and unconsolidated shoreline
</li>
<li>
The relative importance of a site may change within a season, between years, and by species (e.g., Brawn and Stotz 2001, Simons et al. 2004) due to short-term extrinsic factors such as weather and long- term factors such as successional change, changes in abundance of plant species of a site over time, climate change, and modifications of the surrounding landscape.  
</li>
<li>
Habitat characteristics likely influence migrant abundance and site quality for migrants that stop at a site, but we could not model these effects at the relevant scales in this project.  Generally, it appears there is a positive association of migrating landbirds with 1) more complex vegetation structure; 2) early successional habitat, especially during fall migration; 3) perhaps higher plant species richness; and 4) relatively abundant food resources (Hutto 1985, Martin and Karr 1986, Rodewald and Brittingham 2004, Buler et al. 2007).  When considering a site for action, we recommend a site visit to assess these features.

Please keep the following in mind when using the Shorebird Model:
<ul>
<li>
We have not included shorebird species, such as American Golden-Plover, whose primary stopover habitat is dry, upland fields (O’Neal and Alessi 2008) with this ranking system.
</li>
<li>
Shorebird use of any one site may vary with changes in Great Lakes water levels, precipitation before and during migration and, in the case of managed marshes, with the timing of water-level management (Potter et al. 2007).
</li>
<li>
A mosaic of habitats with varying water depths (up to 5 cm deep and 5-20 cm deep) will likely benefit the largest number of shorebird species given the wide range of habitats used by different species (Potter et al. 2007), but this is very difficult to characterize with existing data layers.

Please keep the following in mind when using the Waterfowl Model:
<ul>
<li>
The distribution of waterfowl in the open waters of the Great Lakes is poorly known.   However, recent work (Norris and Lott 2012) indicates that many waterfowl are concentrated closer to the shores of Lake Erie than in offshore waters.  
</li>
<li>
Our depiction of waterfowl distribution during migration almost certainly overstates areas important for waterfowl during migration (e.g., Eastern Habitat Joint Venture 2007) and will be more refined as results from current research, especially in offshore waters, become available.
</li>
<li>
Anthropogenic disturbances including shipping lanes, marinas, public access sites to water, boating traffic and hunting can substantially modify use of otherwise suitable habitat by reducing the amount of time available for foraging or by displacing birds (Knapton et al. 2000, Schummer and Eddelman 2003, Pease et al. 2005, Dooley et al. 2010), but we did not have regionally consistent datasets for these and so did not model their influence.  These disturbances should be considered when contemplating action for waterfowl and evaluating the relative quality of different sites.
</li>
</ul>

        <h4 class="text-info">Setting Stopover Conservation Goals</h4>
         		<p>Although very challenging to establish, articulating conservation goals, based on scientific, operationally realistic, and objective criteria, provides a foundation for estimating the magnitude of work and financial resources needed to achieve conservation results.  Although goals are never perfect, they provide important guidelines to direct our work and, when accomplished, when to celebrate and when to focus resources on other conservation goals.</p>
         		
				<p>For landbirds, we set a goal of 40% of the landscape be in natural cover within  3 miles (5 km) of a site.  The basis for this goal is that several studies, though not all, suggest that landbirds are more crowded, and gain less weight, where less than 15% of the landscape is in suitable habitat compared to landscapes with >15% of suitable habitat and especially with >40% suitable habitat.  We think that the scientific literature is sufficiently consistent to articulate this goal to ensure the health of migrating landbirds.  We recognize that this goal cannot be achieved everywhere, especially in highly developed urban and some agricultural areas.   In these areas goals might focus on improving the quality of existing sites where protecting more habitat is unlikely or can be only be done at very small scales. </p>
				
				<p>We have not yet set goals for shorebirds or waterfowl, as there is insufficient information for shorebirds and waterfowl to define criteria for establishing goals. 
         		</p>
				
         		<p>More research will improve our ability to establish goals but we now have, at least, a conservation goal to measure our progress toward providing safe passage of landbirds through the Great Lakes region.
