The analysis was carried out entirely in ESRI ArcGIS 10. The  ArcGIS ModelBuilder files are included with the data distributed with this report. The ModelBuiler files provide the step-by-step methods and settings used in this project.  While reference is made to the commands and functions as named in ArcMap, substantially similar functionality is available in many currently available GIS software distributions. The data used in this analysis is widely available, public, and free; the exceptions being the ESRI Maps and Data files depicting the roads and the Great Lakes shorelines. In both cases the ESRI data is a proprietary, processed version of public data sources. It should be possible to reproduce this analysis even without access to the ESRI data by using those public sources. The Read Me file contains further detailed information about the data used, its origins, and how it was prepared.
