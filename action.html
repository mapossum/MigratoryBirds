        <h4 class="text-info">Setting Stopover Conservation Goals</h4>
         		<p>Although very challenging to establish, articulating conservation goals, based on scientific, operationally realistic, and objective criteria, provides a foundation for estimating the magnitude of work and financial resources needed to achieve conservation results.  Although goals are never perfect, they provide important guidelines to direct our work and, when accomplished, when to celebrate and when to focus resources on other conservation goals.</p>
         		<p><strong>We (authors of the model shared in the interactive <a href='map.html'>map</a> and detailed in the <a href="download.html">project report</a>) have set goals for migrating landbirds in the Great Lakes region:  READERS, STAY TUNED FOR GOALS. </strong>
         		</p>
         		<p>The basis for this goal is that several studies, though not all, suggest that landbirds are more crowded, and gain less weight, where <15% of the landscape is in suitable habitat compared to landscapes with >15% of suitable habitat and especially with >40% suitable habitat.  We think that the scientific literature is sufficiently consistent to define this landscape feature, the amount of suitable landbird habitat within 5 km of a point, as an important attribute of landscapes that contribute to the health of migrating landbirds.  
	         	<p> <strong>We have not yet set goals for shorebirds or waterfowl, as there is insufficient information for shorebirds and waterfowl to define criteria for establishing goals. </strong></p> 
<p>More research will improve the specificity of these goals but we now, at least, have a specific conservation goal to measure our progress toward providing safe passage of landbirds through the Great Lakes region. </p>

         		<p><strong>Achieving stopover conservation goals </strong></p>
<p>Our models are new and ready to be used.  Earlier stopover models have already driven conservation work.   Exemplary projects include:
<ol>
 <li>Ozaukee County, Wisconsin, Forest Beach Preserve; </li>
 <li>DTE Energy Rouge River Power Plant, Michigan; and </li>
 <li>Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge, Ohio.   
 </ol>
 Each of these projects contributes to achieving landbird migration goals and will clearly benefit shorebirds and waterfowl as well because these sites are in important areas, identified through our model, for these other bird groups.

        <h4 class="text-info">Achieving goals in Ozaukee County, WI: From golf course to stopover site</h4>
         		<p>The Ozaukee Washington Land Trust, working with many partners (NAME), including the Wisconsin Stopover Initiative, assembled the funds and expertise to convert a 46 ha (116 acre) golf course on Lake Michigan to forests, grasslands, and wetlands specifically for stopover habitat for migratory birds.   The county created good stopover habitat from non-suitable habitat to benefit the birds and the public, both of whom now have increased access to the Lake Michigan shore.  CLEAR WITH OZAUKEE LAND TRUST and add their contact info.</p>

        <h4 class="text-info">Achieving goals at the DTE Energy Rouge River Power Plant: A migration oasis in the midst of an urban area</h4>
         		<p>DTE Energy, a Michigan power company that services much of Michigan, recently installed many prairie plants, shrubs and trees at the Rouge River Power Plant along the Detroit River. This site now provides an oasis for birds in the midst of a highly industrialized and residential urban area during migration and at other times of the year, too. Savings are realized as well – there is less mowing to do and, as an extra benefit, fewer greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere.  At this site of 41 ha (105 acres), every spot that is not a building, coal pile, electrical substation, road or parking lot has been naturalized with native plants (trees, shrubs, grasses and wildflowers) to provide approximately 12 ha (30 acres) of habitat for migrating birds and other wildlife.</p>

        <h4 class="text-info">Achieving goals at Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge: Restoring agricultural lands to wetlands and woodlands </h4>
         		<p>Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge, on Lake Erie near Toledo, Ohio, is one of the premier stopover areas for migrating landbirds, shorebirds and waterfowl in the Great Lakes region and attracts birders from throughout the United States, Canada and Europe.  It is surrounded by agricultural land and nearby urban areas.  The refuge, working with Ducks Unlimited and The Nature Conservancy, recently restored, or in the process of restoring, approximately  550 ha (1,400 acres) of agricultural lands to wetlands and woodlands.  Waterfowl, shorebirds and landbirds will now have much more habitat to seek shelter and find food.   The project design also allows for more fish passage to wetlands where they spawn and may provide new habitat for endangered and threatened species.  The newly created habitat increases recreational opportunities such as hunting, fishing, and birding.  More restoration work is planned.  Add their contact info.    </p>
