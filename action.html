        <h4 class="text-info">Setting Stopover Conservation Goals</h4>
         		<p>Although very challenging to establish, articulating conservation goals, based on scientific, operationally realistic, and objective criteria, provides a foundation for estimating the magnitude of work and financial resources needed to achieve conservation results.  Although goals are never perfect, they provide important guidelines to direct our work and, when accomplished, when to celebrate and when to focus resources on other conservation goals.</p>
         		<p><strong>We (authors of the model shared in the interactive <a href='map.html'>map</a> and detailed in the <a href="download.html">project report</a>) have set goals for migrating landbirds in the Great Lakes region:  READERS, STAY TUNED FOR GOALS. </strong>
         		</p>
         		<p>The basis for this goal is that several studies, though not all, suggest that landbirds are more crowded, and gain less weight, where <15% of the landscape is in suitable habitat compared to landscapes with >15% of suitable habitat and especially with >40% suitable habitat.  We think that the scientific literature is sufficiently consistent to define this landscape feature, the amount of suitable landbird habitat within 5 km of a point, as an important attribute of landscapes that contribute to the health of migrating landbirds.  
	         	<p> <strong>We have not yet set goals for shorebirds or waterfowl, as there is insufficient information for shorebirds and waterfowl to define criteria for establishing goals. </strong></p> 
<p>More research will improve the specificity of these goals but we now, at least, have a specific conservation goal to measure our progress toward providing safe passage of landbirds through the Great Lakes region. </p>

<p>Our models are new and ready to be used.  Earlier stopover models have already driven conservation work.   Exemplary projects include:
<ol>
 <li>Ozaukee County, Wisconsin, Forest Beach Preserve; </li>
 <li>DTE Energy Rouge River Power Plant, Michigan; and </li>
 <li>Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge, Ohio.   
 </ol>
 Each of these projects contributes to achieving landbird migration goals and will clearly benefit shorebirds and waterfowl as well because these sites are in important areas, identified through our model, for these other bird groups.

        <h3 class="text-info">SITE:  DTE Energy:  River Rouge Power Plant, Detroit, Michigan</h3>
        <h4 class="text-info">Wildlife Habitat Program: Migratory Bird Benefits and Mowing Elimination</h4>
        By: Craig Tylenda and Jason Cousino, DTE Energy.  26 April 2013
        <h4 class="text-success">INTENDED MIGRATORY BIRD OUTCOMES</h4>
        <p>The goal of the project is to provide “fire escape” stopover sites for migratory landbirds in a highly urbanized environment and secondarily to provide nest sites for Common Terns.</p>
        <h4 class="text-success">BACKGROUND</h4>
        <p>The DTE Energy River Rouge (RRPP) power plant is a coal fire plant located on the Detroit River in River Rouge, Michigan which began operating in 1956 and currently operates two active units that produce more than 600 MW of power. The site has a total area of approximately 105 acres of which approximately 11 acres are actively managed as wildlife habitat, essentially the entire area of the site not actively used for plant operations. Given the plant’s location along a major bird migratory route and the heavily industrialized state of the general area, the site provides a valuable stopover point for migrant birds. Employees at the plant began formal planning of wildlife habitat projects in 2003 and first obtained certification from the Wildlife Habitat Council in 2004. The site was recertified in 2006, 2009 and 2012 while being nominated as the corporate habitat of the year in both 2006 and 2009 and obtaining Regional Corporate Habitat of the Year recognition in 2013.
        </p><p>
The focus of the wildlife habitat projects has been the conversion of both turf grass and barren areas into those which support native plant species.  A majority of the space on the site which is not being utilized for plant operation activities has been transformed into wildlife habitat. As non-native turf grasses provide little or no benefit to most native wildlife, a major focus of the habitat restoration efforts has been the elimination of grass covered areas and replacement with native plants.  The first major project was the removal of grass and installation of native forbs and grasses in a garden of approximately 12,000 square feet. The latest endeavor has been the conversion of a turf grass covered 5-acre field into a habitat approximating something of an oak savanna type array of plants and trees. The establishment of wildlife habitat has eliminated much of the need to mow lawns on the site.  The effort has resulted in the near elimination of mowing and cost savings of approximately $50,000 per year, a diversity of wildlife habitat, and has helped instill an understanding of the benefits of utilizing native plants in landscaping.   Prescribed burns are conducted at plantings for fire-dependent native plant species. 
</p>
	  <h4 class="text-success">RESTORATION PLAN, RESULTS AND PROJECT SUMMARIES</h4>
	  <p>
	  The employees at the plant have conducted a number of habitat related projects including the installations of various nest boxes, public outreach events, and coyote research among others. The following details only those projects which directly improve or create habitat for birds.
	  </p>
<div style="text-decoration:underline">River Rouge Nature Area</div>
   	 <p>
One of the most recent projects initiated at RRPP the RRPP Nature Area is the largest single project for wildlife habitat on the site. Slightly less than 5-acres, and located just outside of the plant grounds approximately 1/3-mile from the Detroit River shoreline, a turf grass field was being maintained through extensive mowing throughout the year. Beginning in 2010 the grass was killed, berms established along the roadways, bluebird / tree swallow nest boxes installed, and vegetation established that would approximate oak-savanna type diversity. 
	  </p>
	 <p><b>Area:</b> Approximately 5-acres</p>
<p><b>Goals:</b> Provide additional habitat for wildlife, provide opportunities for school classes to engage in field trips that educate on wildlife habitat, and reduce the mowing expense.</p>
<p><b>Approximate Cost:</b> $45,000</p>
<p><b>Approximate Mowing Reduction</b>  $10,000 / year</p>
<p>A total of 53 shrubs and trees were planted to compliment several evergreens which were already present:</p>

<ul>
<li>(15) Serviceberry (Amelanchier arborea) – 8 foot tall</li>
<li>(8) Red Maple (Acer rubrum)  - 3" diameter</li>
<li>(8) Sugar Maple (Acer saccharum) - 3" diameter</li>
<li>(8) Swamp White Oak (Quercus bicolor) - 4” diameter</li>
<li>(3) Swamp White Oak (Quercus bicolor) - 5" diameter</li>
<li>(7) Northern Red Oak (Quercus rubra) - 3" diameter</li>
<li>(2) Northern Red Oak (Quercus rubra) - 4" diameter</li>
<li>(2) Pin Oak (Quercus palustris) - 4" diameter</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the area was seeded with a prairie mixture:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Andropogon gerardii</i> - Big Bluestem</li> 
<li><i>Bouteloua curtipendula-</i>  Side-Oats Grama</li> 
<li><i>Carex</i> spp. Prairie Sedge Mix </li>
<li><i>Elymus canadensis</i> - Canada Wild Rye</li> 
<li><i>Panicum virgatum</i> - Switch Grass </li>
<li><i>Schizachyrium scoparium</i>- Little Bluestem</li> 
<li><i>Sorghastrum nutans </i>- Indian Grass </li>

<li><i>Avena sativa</i> -Common Oat </li>
<li><i>Lolium multiflorum </i>- Annual Rye</li> 

<li><i>Asclepias syriaca</i> -Common Milkweed</li>
<li><i>Asclepias tuberosa</i>- Butterfly  Weed </li>
<li><i>Aster laevis</i> - Smooth Blue Aster </li>
<li><i>Aster novae-angliae</i> - New England Aster</li>
<li><i>Chamaecrista fasciculate</i>- Partridge Pea </li>
<li><i>Coreopsis lanceolata</i> - Sand Coreopsis </li>
<li><i>Echinacea purpurea</i> - Broad-Leaved Purple Coneflower </li> 
<li><i>Heliopsis helianthoides</i> - False Sunflower </li> 
<li><i>Lupinus perennis</i> - Wild Lupine </li>
<li><i>Monarda fistulosa</i> - Wild Bergamot 0.25 </li>
<li><i>Pycnanthemum virginianum</i> - Common Mountain Mint </li>
<li><i>Ratibida pinnata</i> - Yellow Coneflower </li>
<li><i>Rudbeckia hirta</i> - Black-eyed Susan </li>
</ul>

<div style="text-decoration:underline">Shoreline Plantings</div>
   	 <p>
The site’s Detroit River shoreline has been substantially improved over the past seven years with the work performed in phases over this period. The area was original a mixture of mostly grass and gravel covered surfaces with Austrian pines which had been planted, willows which had been planted and also self-established, and various shrubby plants including hawthorn. The primary invasive plant was common buckthorn which has been effectively controlled. The areas are now primarily native plants including grasses, forbs, and shrubs such as serviceberry, dogwood, and holly. 
	  </p>
<p><b>Area:</b> Approximately 1 acre</p>
<p><b>Goals:</b> Provide additional habitat for wildlife, reduce the mowing expense, and improve aesthetics.</p>
<p><b>Approximate Cost:</b> $25,000</p>
<p><b>Approximate Mowing Reduction</b>  $5,000 / yearBalance of Site</p>
<p>In addition to the previous two projects which were identified, the balance of the site which was being mowed has been planted with native plants or simply allowed to revegetate. This includes a ¼ mile long berm which already had a multitude of trees growing on it but which had its undergrowth mowed. A multitude of native shrubs were planted to create additional shade and thickness, controlling grass growth.</p>

In support of the common tern rookery restorations which are occurring along the Detroit River, two former freighter mooring cells were modified to provide a nest site for common terns. The walls of the cells were built higher to prevent tern chicks from falling into the water, placement of gravel and sand, and a seasonal installation of decoys and sound system which plays tern calls. The surrounding waters provide the small fish which the terns prefer.

        <h3 class="text-info">SITE:  Forest Beach Migratory Preserve, Ozaukee, Wisconsin</h3>
        <h4 class="text-info">Creation of the Forest Beach Migratory Preserve</h4>
        By: Kim Grveles, Wisconsin Stopover Initiative Coordinator, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and Shaw Graff, Executive Director, Ozaukee Washington Land Trust.  30 April 2013.
        <h4 class="text-success">INTENDED MIGRATORY BIRD OUTCOMES</h4>
        <p>The goal of the project is to provide stopover sites for migrating landbirds, shorebirds and waterfowl.</p>
        <h4 class="text-success">BACKGROUND</h4>
        <p>In 2007, the Wisconsin Stopover Initiative (WISI) used migratory bird stopover habitat models developed for Wisconsin’s Lake Michigan basin to evaluate a site and surrounding landscape in northern Ozaukee County.   The site, known as Squires Country Club, was a 142-acre golf course located 600 feet inland from the Lake Michigan shore and included 100 feet of sandy beach on the shore.  The Ozaukee Washington Land Trust (OWLT) was considering acquisition of the property to restore habitat for wildlife.  OWLT was particularly interested in providing stopover habitat for shorebirds and waterfowl and wanted to know if the property had value for other bird groups.
        </p>
	  <h4 class="text-success">Application of WISI Stopover Habitat Models.</h4>
	  <p>
	  WISI examined three habitat models – landbird, shorebird, and waterfowl/waterbird – for migratory bird stopover potential at Squires County Club and adjacent areas.  The landbird model revealed woody cover less than ¼ mile from Lake Michigan immediately east of the property with wooded wetlands and oak cover adjacent on the west (see Fig. 1).  These very high priority habitat features were separated by mowed golf course fairways, a small (5-acre) mature woodlot, and ponds that served as “water hazards” for golfers.  Restoration of upland golf fairways, including planting native trees and shrubs, would connect the existing habitat corridors, increasing the amount of stopover habitat available for landbirds in close proximity to the shore.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
The shorebird model indicated hydric soils were present on the property, but removal of drain tiles would be necessary to restore wetlands with mudflats for shorebird stopover habitat.  According to the model, drained hydric soils located less than 10 miles from the Lake ranked as a high priority shorebird stopover habitat attribute because flooding in wet years had potential to provide foraging opportunities.  Restoration of wetlands on these soils would increase the ranking to very high priority for shorebirds.
	  </p>
<p>
For waterfowl/waterbirds, near-shore (&lt;1/4 mile) open water of Lake Michigan was the nearest priority stopover habitat feature to the property.  Hydric soils on the property ranked as low priority, but would score as high to very high priority if restored to emergent marsh depending on size.  Also, a small hardwood forested wetland adjacent to the property had potential to be used as stopover by some species of waterfowl (i.e. Wood Duck) and waterbirds (i.e. Green Heron). 
</p>

<h4 class="text-success">Funding Sources: Acquisition and Restoration</h4>
	  <p>
	  Funding was provided by multiple sources, with the largest portion coming from the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program administered by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.  A loan as well as a major donation from Lake Road Properties, a private property holding company, allowed OWLT to close on the property in January, 2009 prior to receiving the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship grant award.  In turn, OWLT sold 25 acres at the south end of the property to the holding company, which owned surrounding property.  OWLT retained 116 acres that then became Forest Beach Migratory Preserve (FBMP).  Various smaller grants and donations from individuals were also used to complete the acquisition. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
In 2009, OWLT was awarded an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Grant through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  Purpose of the funding was to implement shovel-ready restoration activities, while stimulating the local economy by utilizing local contractors, businesses, and professionals for restoration activities.  Amount of the grant award was $451,000, enough to pay for 10 years worth of restoration work, but the work had to be completed within an 18-month period.
	  </p>

<h4 class="text-success">Support for Acquisition</h4>
	  <p>
With assistance from conservation partner organizations including WISI, OWLT promoted the potential value of the site for migratory birds and stopover habitat.  Although the township board was initially opposed to this acquisition, the public rallied behind the project and eventually convinced the town board to drop its opposition.  Citizens recognized the importance of preserving this last large tract of open space on Lake Michigan in the county.  To further build support, OWLT met with neighbors, who mostly viewed the project as a good alternative to commercial development.  Professionals, neighbors, and local citizens testified in favor of the acquisition at township and county board meetings, while opposition to the project remained minimal.   
	  </p>

<h4 class="text-success">RESTORATION PLAN, RESULTS AND PROJECT SUMMARY</h4>
	  <p>
OWLT invited partner organizations and neighbors to discuss development of a restoration plan.  From the first meeting in March, 2009, a technical advisory committee was formed and Cedarburg Science, a local environmental consulting firm, was hired to coordinate the committee and to draft the plan (to access the plan go to <a target="_blank" href='http://owlt.org/visit-our-preserves/forest-beach-migratory-preserve/habitat-restoration-plan'>http://owlt.org/visit-our-preserves/forest-beach-migratory-preserve/habitat-restoration-plan</a> ).  The restoration concept includes creating a patchwork of ten habitat types in the upland areas: Lake Michigan shoreline, mixed hardwood forest, savanna, oak savanna, conifer area, shrubland, wetlands including 5 constructed ponds, old field, native grasslands, and mowed, cool season grasslands.  These habitats were designed to increase the diversity and abundance of feeding and resting areas used by a myriad of migratory bird species, with an emphasis on those listed as endangered or threatened or designated as species of conservation concern.  Multiple wetland areas were restored to not only support birds, but also reptiles, amphibians, and aquatic invertebrates.  An interpretive trail winds through all habitat types and includes observation platforms, a photography blind, and educational signs.  Additional goals of the project included facilitating groundwater recharge, enhancing carbon sequestration, and improving Lake Michigan water quality by eliminating chemical and fertilizer applications and reducing water use requirements on the site.  By providing public access and nature-based recreational and educational opportunities to the Lake Michigan coastal area, OWLT and partners hope to increase awareness and appreciation for migratory birds and natural resource conservation.

         		<p>The Ozaukee Washington Land Trust, working with many partners (NAME), including the Wisconsin Stopover Initiative, assembled the funds and expertise to convert a 46 ha (116 acre) golf course on Lake Michigan to forests, grasslands, and wetlands specifically for stopover habitat for migratory birds.   The county created good stopover habitat from non-suitable habitat to benefit the birds and the public, both of whom now have increased access to the Lake Michigan shore.

         		<p>DTE Energy, a Michigan power company that services much of Michigan, recently installed many prairie plants, shrubs and trees at the Rouge River Power Plant along the Detroit River. This site now provides an oasis for birds in the midst of a highly industrialized and residential urban area during migration and at other times of the year, too. Savings are realized as well – there is less mowing to do and, as an extra benefit, fewer greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere.  At this site of 41 ha (105 acres), every spot that is not a building, coal pile, electrical substation, road or parking lot has been naturalized with native plants (trees, shrubs, grasses and wildflowers) to provide approximately 12 ha (30 acres) of habitat for migrating birds and other wildlife.</p>

         		<p>Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge, on Lake Erie near Toledo, Ohio, is one of the premier stopover areas for migrating landbirds, shorebirds and waterfowl in the Great Lakes region and attracts birders from throughout the United States, Canada and Europe.  It is surrounded by agricultural land and nearby urban areas.  The refuge, working with Ducks Unlimited and The Nature Conservancy, recently restored, or in the process of restoring, approximately  550 ha (1,400 acres) of agricultural lands to wetlands and woodlands.  Waterfowl, shorebirds and landbirds will now have much more habitat to seek shelter and find food.   The project design also allows for more fish passage to wetlands where they spawn and may provide new habitat for endangered and threatened species.  The newly created habitat increases recreational opportunities such as hunting, fishing, and birding.  More restoration work is planned.  Add their contact info.    </p>
